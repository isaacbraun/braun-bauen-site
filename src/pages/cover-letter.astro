    filtering and search web app for university endowments.

    develop features within an enterprise CMS and improve accessibility and performance

    <br />
    <br />
    With my experience in front-end development, and my continual hunger to learn
    and create incredible user experiences, I am confident I am a great fit for this
    role. I appreciate your consideration, and anticipate the chance to [help...].
